# Spotify Final Project

## Selected Topic and Reason 

We analyzed a dataset of Spotify tracks over a range of 125 different genres, including a 114,000 tracks to see which features are the most predictive in determining the popularity of the track. We plan on using Python, Pandas, Flask, Tableau, among others. Our hope is to produce a web page that will share the findings, enabling a user to explore the data and enter characteristics to predict the popularity of a track. 

We chose this topic as our entire group is highly interested in music and wanted to have a better understanding of how a track becomes a hit. 

## Questions they hope to answer with the data

- What features are the most predictive in determining track popularity?
- What are the optimal combination of features for popular tracks?
- Are there any differences across genres?

## Description of the communication protocols

Our group will meet regularly during class times (Tuesdays and Thursdays from 7 to 9 pm). We will also be meeting on the weekend, with date and time being decided during our class time based on availability. We will be assigning separate tasks for completion and following up during our meetings. We also have a channel set up on slack for regular day-to-day communication.
